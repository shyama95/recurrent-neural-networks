# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
## Abstract
An implementation of vanilla recurrent neural network in python (without libraries) for a "many-to-one" classification task.  

* **models** folder: model parameters are saved in this folder when ```trainModel.py``` is run
* **bestModel** folder: has the parameters for the best trained model for this implementation
* **src** folder: has the implementation of the RNN
* **testData** folder: has the test data
* **trainingData** folder: has the training data and labels
* **trainModel.py**: code to train the network
* **testModel.py**: code to test the trained network
* **testPrediction.csv**: output of the trained network. Genetated when testModel.py is run

## Dependencies
- python v3
- python libraries : numpy
